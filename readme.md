# Hash.js - URL Hash Manipulation

Hash.js is a 0.5 KB script that lets you in a super simple way manipulate
everything behind `#` in urls. Tested in latest Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE7,8,9.

See example page at [jonnystromberg.com/hash-js](http://jonnystromberg.com/hash-js) or see it
in action at [PNGTextures.com](http://pngtextures.com).

Btw, [follow me (@javve) at Twitter](http://twitter.com/javve) and checkout my other project [List.js](http://listjs.com)

**Notice**:  The main focus of Hash.js is simplcity. This is no tool for your super-ajax-native-feeling-app-with-google-bot-support. If
that's your usage situation, use the awesome [History.js](https://github.com/balupton/history.js).

## Usage
Just include `hash.min.js` or `hash.js` at your site and then a `hash` object will become available.

    <script src="hash.min.js"></script>

    <script>
        hash.add({foo: "bar" });                // Url becomes http://url.com#foo=bar
    </scrtip>

## Methods

* **hash.add(params)**  
Add parameter to hash

        hash.add({ foo: "bar" });               // http://url.com#foo=bar
        hash.add({ car: "dar", sar: "par" });   // http://url.com#foo=bar&car=dar&sar=par

* **hash.get(param)** or **hash.get(param, url)** or **hash.get()** or **hash.get(undefined, url)**  
Returns value of paramter in hash. If `param` is `undefined` then all values are returned.

        var fooValue = hash.get('foo'); // fooValue == "bar"
        var fooValue = hash.get('foo','http://domain.tld/#foo=bar'); // fooValue == "bar"
        var allValues = hash.get(); // allValues == { foo: "bar", car: "dar", sar: "par"}
        var allValues = hash.get(undefined,'http://domain.tld/#foo=bar&car=dar'); // allValues == { foo: "bar", car: "dar"}

* **hash.remove(param)**  
Removes the value with name `param`.

        hash.remove('foo');                     // http://url.com#car=dar&sar=par

* **hash.clear()**  
Clears entire hash.

        hash.clear();                           // http://url.com#

* **hash.onchange(function(){})**  
Callback on hash change.

        hash.onchange(function(){alert('hash changed !');});
